#Hi#

This is a [Markdown][2] live editor built using [WMD][3] and other open source tools. I use it to write entries for my [posterous][4] blog and other places where Markdown is needed.

##Usage##

When you press the *copy markdown* button you'll get the markdown markup wrapped in `markdown` and `p` tags, so you can send it as an email to post@posterous.com to create a new entry for your own blog.

> *if your browser supports HTML 5, this text will be stored locally*

###Adding images###
![alt text][5]

###Writting code ##![alt text][6]#

    #!javascript
    function hi(){
        alert('hi!');
    }
